# Tweet Validity Classifier
Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier used for classifying tweets as either factual or misleading/fake. <br />
It takes .tsv files containing tweets as training/test data and then outputs trace files containing detailed analysis depending on which model of Naive Bayes is chosen to be applied. <br />
LSTM model is applied in parallel so results can be compared. <br />
